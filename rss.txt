We have an existing Django backend using the Oscar ecommerce framework with a built-in API. We&#039;ve purchased a Next.js template for the frontend but need help integrating the two seamlessly.<br /><br />
Key Responsibilities:<br /><br />
API Integration:<br />
Analyze the Oscar API endpoints and data structures.<br />
Adapt the Next.js template components to fetch and display product data, category information, shopping cart details, and other relevant information from the Django backend.<br />
Troubleshoot and resolve any issues preventing successful data display.<br />
Data Formatting:<br />
Evaluate whether data formatting is the root cause of display issues.<br />
If needed, implement appropriate data transformations or normalization on the frontend or backend to ensure compatibility.<br />
State Management:<br />
Implement state management solutions (e.g., React Context, Redux, Zustand) to handle shopping cart updates, product selections, and user interactions.<br /><br /><br />
Required Skills &amp;amp; Experience:<br /><br />
Proficiency in Next.js: Strong understanding of Next.js concepts (server-side rendering, routing, component architecture).<br />
REST API Experience: Experience working with RESTful APIs, particularly consuming data.<br />
JavaScript Expertise: Advanced knowledge of JavaScript (ES6+) and React.<br />
Django/Oscar Familiarity (Preferred): Basic understanding of Django and the Oscar framework would be beneficial.<br />

BACKSTORY:<br /><br />
We already have a PYTHON/AWS based restaurant scraper the pulls data from Uber Eats, Door Dash,&nbsp;&nbsp;and alike. We also have an AI based scraper that can pull data from images and some more complicated or challenging menus. These are then pulled into a holding queue for manual review, parsing and sorting before it is imported into the final DB for accuracy. The mobile application(s), CRM, website(s) are built in REACT. The current database is utilizing FIREBASE.<br /><br />
==============================================<br /><br />
JOB SCOPE: <br /><br />
We are looking for the next upgrade to our restaurant scraper:<br /><br />
1. SCRAPE MENU DATA FOR INDIVIDUAL RESTAURANT: <br /><br />
Version 1.0 will be done on a one-by-one basis manually, with larger versions to automate this for a larger setting to be done. For example, you set to pull 5/10/25 @ a time. Example provided in the attachment(s). Google Places API provides us the &amp;quot;place_id&amp;quot; (ie: ChIJa5DJ9TedF4gRuRi9kzhuRP8) identification for each restaurant, that can be used by the scraper to locate a specific restaurant for the scraping process.<br /><br />
2. IMPORT DATA&nbsp;&nbsp;(including title/header/categories) into the parsing manual review queue. <br /><br />
Google Menus are already nicely sorted into categories/titles for each section. We want to preserve this structure. It will be pulled into our parsing holding queue (we already have this for our other scrapers, uber eats, etc) and would then be manually reviewed and sorted before final DB import.<br /><br /><br />
3. INTEGRATE INTO ADMIN PORTAL (if needed.) <br /><br />
It is will manually sorted for proper format before final import into the DB in the ADMIN PORTAL.<br /><br />
You would be required to come up with a FIXED PRICE/MILESTONES for this contract. You will need to work within any existing Python/ReactJS developer(s) code &amp;amp; restrictions on the team as needed. If you cannot work within other developers code, DO NOT BID ON THIS JOB!<br /><br /><br />
==============================================<br /><br />
First Things First:<br /><br />
++ WE MANUALLY REVIEW ALL 100+ APPLICANTS.<br />
++ WE SEEK MARKET VALUE RATES TAILORED TO SPECIFIC TASKS.<br />
++ HIRE TOP-RATING/10K EARNINGS/UW EXPERIENCED PROFESSIONALS<br />
++ MUST MEET DEADLINES. WILL BE RATED/REVIEWED ACCORDING.<br />
++ MUST WORK AS PART OF TEAM/COOPERATIVE IN EXISTING CODE.<br />
++ YOUR GITHUB/CODE TO BE REVIEWED BY EXISTING TEAM PRIOR<br /><br />
You can check our job history and the volume of projects in the past year(s). We are only looking for those who are professionals and can delivery quality work on their deadlines. If you are overbooked on your projects, this one is not for you!<br /><br />
==============================================<br /><br />
EXPERIENCE/REQUIREMENTS:<br /><br />
-- FIREBASE DB<br />
-- REACTJS/NATIVE<br />
-- PYTHON (data scraper)<br />
-- MONDAY PM (you must communication/work as a team)<br />
-- FIXED BUDGET<br />
-- SIGN NDA<br />
-- DETAILED COMPREHENSIVE PROPOSAL ***<br /><br /><br />
***&nbsp;&nbsp;We will not accept &#039;proposals&#039; that are a couple of sentences with arbitrary vague information, including fly-by-night deadlines and asking for thousands. We only work with professionals who present themselves as such. This includes providing documentation of scope and scale, so we know what we are paying for! This protects both sides and sets proper expectations before going into a contract.<br /><br />
==============================================<br /><br />
HOURLY CONTRACTS:<br /><br />
You must do a zoom call every 2 business showing us the progress for the hours being churned. If you&#039;re claiming 40 hours per week, we expect to see 40 hours worth of progress per week.<br /><br />
MILESTONES:<br /><br />
If you have not provided 100% deliverables, GITHUB, FIGMA, ZIP FILES, etc., do not submit a request for payment. We should have updated code, or deliverables, every step of the way for review. This is often missed, and then we have to chase it down, causing unnecessary frustration.<br /><br />
==============================================<br /><br />
REASONS YOU WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED:<br />
ï»¿<br />
++ AI Autoresponders/Immediate Elimination.<br />
++ Asking for Phone Calls When None is Needed/All Information Job Post<br />
++ Demanding a Minimum 40/80 Hours on Jobs That Do Not Require It<br />
++ Bad Reviews/Ratings. Particularly Where You Do not Meet Deadlines.<br />
++ Delays in Provided Basic Proposal for Easy Jobs.<br />
++ Vague/Incomplete/Dismissal of Q&amp;amp;A on More Complicated Job Posting<br />
++ Limited UW Experience/Reviews/Ratings<br /><br /><br />
